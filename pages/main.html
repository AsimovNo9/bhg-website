	<h1>Welcome to the Bend Hackers Guild</h1>

	The Guild is a place for geek enthusiasts of all types to gather,
	exchange information, learn new things, and have fun. Topics trend toward
	tech, but no topic is off limits.

	<h2>Meetups</h2>

	We have a meetup on the second Wednesday of the month, usually a
	presentation. Sometimes we have social gatherings (game night, movie night,
	etc.) on other days.

	<p>The Guild also teaches classes. Check the Meetup page or <a href="#page-cal" data-pageref="true">calendar</a> for
	more information, and contact us if you want to teach one.
