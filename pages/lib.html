	<h1>Library</h1>

	Bend Hackers Guild has a library of books maintained by our members. Each
	member has their own "branch" and handles their own checkouts.


	<h2>How to Check Out Books</h2>

	First, make a new account (or just log in with Facebook):
	<ul><li><a href="https://librarika.com/users/register">https://librarika.com/users/register</a></li></ul>

	<p>Second, visit our library page and browse:
	<ul><li><a href="https://bhg.librarika.com/">https://bhg.librarika.com/</a></li></ul>

	<p>When you've selected a book, Josh will tell me how to finish these instructions.


	<h2>How to Open Your Own Branch</h2>

	If you have books you're willing to loan, you can start your own branch.
