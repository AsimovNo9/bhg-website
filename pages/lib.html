	<h1>Library</h1>

	Bend Hackers Guild has a library of physical books maintained by our
	members. Everyone's free to borrow books. Each "librarian" has their own
	"branch" and handles their own checkouts.

	<h2 id="lib-member-howto">How to Become a Member (i.e. how to get a "library card")</h2>

	<ol>
		<li><a href="https://librarika.com/users/register">Make a new account</a> (or just log in with Facebook).

		<li><a href="https://bhg.librarika.com/">Visit our library page</a>.

		<li>Try to log in. You will get a "Forbidden" message. Don't fret.

		<li>Click the "Request Member Access" button.

		<li>Eagerly await approval.
	</ol>


	<h2>How to Check Out a Book</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="https://bhg.librarika.com/">Visit our library page</a>.

		<li>Search for a book with "Catalog Search" or browse with "Top Collections".

		<li>When you've selected a book, scroll down and click "Request", select your requested dates, then "Submit".

		<li>Await email from the branch owner letting you know where and when to get the book.

		<li>The librarian will hand you the book and change the book's status to "Checked Out".
	</ol>


	<h2>How to Check In a Book</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Physically return the book to the librarian from whom you borrowed it. The librarian will change the book's status to "Checked In".

		<li>If you got to this step, you must have an overdue book. Please return it. :)
	</ol>


	<h2>How to Open Your Own Branch (admin)</h2>

	If you have books you're willing to loan, you can start your own branch.
	Contact <a href="mailto:beej@beej.us">beej@beej.us</a>.

	<p>Optionally, you can also write your name in your book (so we know
	to whom to return it eventually) and hand it over to an existing
	librarian to manage for you. Of course, this means you'll have to
	check out your own book if you want to read it.


	<h2>How to Add a Book (admin)</h2>

	<ol>
		<li>Click your icon in the upper right, and select "Dashboard".
		<li>Pull down "Catalogs→Catalog Items".
		<li>Click "Smart Add".
		<li>Enter an ISBN number. For books with no ISBN, you can enter
		an <a
		href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200202190#find_asins">ASIN</a>.
		<li>Select the appropriate branch.
		<li>Enter your best guess at a category, e.g. "Computer
		Science", "Software Engineering", "Mathematics", etc.
		<li>Click Auto Save.
	</ol>

	<h2>How to Manage Circulation (admin)</h2>

	From the Admin menu, select Circulation→Circulation.

	<p>Books are one of three states:

	<p><ul>
		<li><b>Requested</b>: The user requested a book. Not yet reserved. Click "Issue" to reserve.
		<li><b>Reserved</b>: The book is reserved for a user for the requested dates. Click "Check Out" to check out when you phyically hand the book over.
		<li><b>Checked out</b>: The user physically has the book. When the user physically hands the book back, click "Check In".
		<li><b>Checked in</b>: The unrequested, unreserved book is at home on your shelf.
	</ul>


	<h2>Email (admin)</h2>

	All librarians get a mail when someone requests a book. We currently don't
	know how to restrict this to per-branch.
	
	<p>If you think it might be one of your books, log in and manage circulation
	(above). Make sure it was requested from your branch. If so, proceed. If
	not, ignore.
